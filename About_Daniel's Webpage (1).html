</h1>
<h1 style="background-color: yellow;">Why did I choose Information Technology (IT)<br>
</h1>
<h2 style="background-color: orange; color: white; text-align: left;">I
decided to major in Information Technology because technology has
become a big part of our life. We make calls, write documents,
reminders, and learn, mostly through means of technology. While
technology is not completely a part of our lives, it is a fulfills a
large part of our daily needs. For example, in my Operating Systems
class, we are supposed to study systems and work with them.
Participating in this class also allowed me to understand software like
Virtualbox and VM-Ware better because they fall under the category of
"Operating Systems". You and I every day use operating systems like
Windows, Linux, etc. Think of something which would require you to use
technology. If it wasn't for technology, it wouldn't be possible. For
example, if you were doing a research paper, you could save a trip to
the library by using your browser and going onto websites that have the
information necessary for your research project. If your teacher has a
specific way of citing sources, you can find a way to fulfill the
teacher's requirement. It's just one Google search away.</h2>
